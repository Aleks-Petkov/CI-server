# Team

The group started off with a meeting to understand the assignment. During the meeting, some skeleton code was made to create a working environment using gradle for building, running and testing that everyone could use. An agile workflow was used where tickets were created using GitHub's Project board function [here](https://github.com/Aleks-Petkov/CI-server/projects/1). Assignment 2 required a more sequential way of working compared to assignment 1, therefore almost everybody worked on two issues at the same time, to then adapt a more parallel-programing way of working. Slack was used to communicate as well as Zoom after the first meeting. The members kept in contact via Slack throughout for both planning as well as for helping each other. 

According to the checklist the group is probably around the stage "collaborating", in our way of working, described in Essence v1.2. The checklist for "collaborating", is the following:
"The team is working as one cohesive unit.
Communication within the team is open and honest.
The team is focused on achieving the team mission.
The team members know and trust each other"

The group fulfills almost all the criterias, but perhaps it can not be said that the team members know each other, since we have only been working online for just two weeks. During the coming assignments we will hopefully know each other since more time have been spend together, and we can move on to the next stage.
